# Turing3D
3D rendering engine written by me from scratch

To run, have Turing 4.1.1 installed, and run the main file (3D engine/3DBaseTemplate.t)

The other 2 .t files and the folder that are in the main directory are subsequently more pared-down versions of the engine, to help viewers get a grasp of a simpler example.
